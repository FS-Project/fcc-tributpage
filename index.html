        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong> 1834 </strong> - When Radin Inten II was born in 1834, his father, Radin Imba II, was captured by the Belanda and exiled to Timor, as a result of leading an armed resistance against the Belanda presence who wanted to
            colonize Lampung. His pregnant wife, Ratu Mas, was not taken into exile. The Keratuan Lampung government is run by a Belanda-controlled Trusteeship Council.
            <p>
              Radin Inten II never knew his real father, but his mother always told him about his father's struggle so that when he was crowned Queen Negara Ratu, Radin Inten II continued to struggle to lead the people in the Lampung area
              to defend the sovereignty and integrity of the territory. His struggle was widely supported by the people of the Lampung area and received assistance from other areas, such as Banten.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of them is H. Wakhia, a Banten figure who once fought against the Belanda and then fled to Lampung. Radin Inten II appointed H. Wakhia as his advisor. H. Wakhia mobilized resistance in the Semangka and Sekampung areas by
              attacking Belanda military posts. Another figure who is also the main supporter of Radin Inten II is Singa Beranta, the head of the Rajabasa clan. Meanwhile, Radin Inten II strengthened existing fortresses and built new ones.
              These fortresses were armed with cannons, lilacs and traditional weapons. Food items such as rice and livestock were prepared in the fort to face the war which was expected to last a long time. All of these forts were situated
              on steep mountain ridges, making it difficult for the enemy to reach them. Several warlords were assigned to lead the fortresses. Singaberanta, for example, led the Bendulu fortress, while Radin Inten II himself led the
              Ketimbang fort.

          <li>
            <strong> 1851 </strong> - in 1851 the Belanda sent troops from Batavia. This 400-strong troop led by Captain Jucht was tasked with capturing the Merambung fort. However, they were beaten back by Radin Inten II's troops. Because
            they failed to take Merambung, the Belanda changed tactics. Captain Kohler, Assistant Resident of the Netherlands at Teluk Betung, was assigned to hold negotiations with Radin Inten II. After holding negotiations several times,
            finally an agreement was reached not to attack each other. The Netherlands recognizes the existence of the Queen State. Raden Inten II also recognized Belanda rule in the places they had occupied. The agreement was used by the
            Belanda only as a cool pause to wait for the opportunity to launch a massive attack. For them in any way, Raden Inten II must be subdued. The Belanda are sure that as long as Radin Inten II is still in power, their position in
            Lampung will remain under threat. However, before starting new attacks, the Belanda tried to divide the people of Lampung. One group pitted against another group. Among the people there was an atmosphere of mutual suspicion. The
            task was entrusted to Captain Kohler. In several places his business was successful. Kalianda community leaders, for example, were consumed by incitement to antagonize Radin Inten II, so that they did not obstruct the Belanda
            troops from patrolling around Mount Rajabasa.

              The Belanda were sure that as long as Radin Inten II was still in power, their position in Lampung would still be threatened. However, before starting new attacks, the Belanda tried to divide the people of Lampung. One group
              pitted against another group. Among the people there was an atmosphere of mutual suspicion. The task was entrusted to Captain Kohler.

            <strong> 1856 </strong> - On August 10, 1856, Belanda troops departed from Batavia with several warships. This troop was led by Colonel Welson and consisted of infantry, artillery and engineering troops accompanied by a large
            number of porters. The next day they landed in Canti. Their strength increased with the joining of the troops of Pangeran Sempurna Jaya Putih, a Lampung nobleman who had sided with the Belanda. The Belanda warship that entered
            Lampung waters was seen by Singaberanta from Bendulu Fortress. He immediately sent a courier to Fort Ketimbang to inform Radin Inten II who then ordered his troops in other fortresses to prepare themselves. The Belanda sent an
            ultimatum to Radin Inten II so that at the latest within five days he and all his troops would surrender. If not, the Netherlands will launch an attack. Singaberanta was sent a letter inviting him to make peace. While waiting
            for answers from Radin Inten II and Singaberanta, the Belanda troops consolidated. Radin Inten II has also stepped up its preparations. Fortresses were strengthened. Some of his confidants were ordered to enter areas that were
            already under Belanda control to encourage the inhabitants of that place to put up a fight. Until the end of the ultimatum deadline, neither Radin Inten II nor Singaberanta gave an answer.
            <p>
              So, on August 16, 1856 the Belanda troops began their attack. Their goal that day was to take Bendulu Fortress. At 08.00 they arrived in Bendulu after traveling a fairly steep mountain ridge. However, they found the fortress
              empty. Singaberanta has already moved its troops to another place. He deliberately avoided open war, believing that the opposing forces he faced were much stronger. The troops were deployed in quite hidden places with the task
              of intercepting the patrols of the Belanda troops leaving the fort. After occupying Bendulu Fortress, some of the Belanda troops moved to the Hawi Berak fort which they were able to control on August 19. In Bendulu, the
              Belanda troops managed to capture a nephew of Singaberanta and 14 other people. They were forced to point out Singaberanta's place and show them the way to Ketimbang. Everyone said they didn't know. However, they were forced
              to show Singaberanta where the weapons were stored, including 25 gunpowder tubes, 1 cannon, 4 lilacs, and several rifles.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main objective of the Belanda was to seize the Ketimbang fort, because it was in this fortress that Radin Inten II survived. To seize this fort, Colonel Waleson trebled his troops. One troop moved from Bendulu to the south
              and east of Mount Rajabasa, one troop moved towards Kalianda and Way Urang with the task of capturing Merambung fort and after that went straight to Ketimbang. The third army moved from Panengah to seize the Salai Tabuhan fort
              and then headed for Ketimbang. As it turned out, the implementation was not as easy as planned. The main difficulty is that the Netherlands does not yet know the way to Ketimbang. The people who were caught did not want to
              show them the way. Therefore, the troops which were directly led by Colonel Welson and had already occupied Hawi Berak, were forced to return to Bendulu. Other troops led by Major Van Ostade managed to reach Way Urang whose
              inhabitants had already sided with the Belanda. Although these troops had been detained in Kelau due to attacks launched by Radin Inten II's troops, they finally succeeded in capturing the Merambung fort. Actually, the
              location of the Ketimbang fort is not far from the Merambung fort. However, the Belanda didn't know about it. The difficulty of knowing the way to Ketimbang they were able to overcome until 26 August. On that day the Belanda
              managed to arrest two young people. One of them was shot dead for trying to escape. The other was threatened with death if he refused to show him the way to Ketimbang. The young man was forced to obey the will of the
              Netherlands.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the road to Ketimbang was known, Colonel Welson immediately ordered his troops to attack. At dawn on August 27 they started moving. When they arrived at Galah Tanah at 10.00 they were intercepted by Radin Inten II's
              troops. The battle in this place was won by the Belanda. Likewise the next battle at Pematang Sentok. Some of the troops were left at Pematang Sentok and some continued the movement to Ketimbang. At midday these troops arrived
              at Ketimbang. After that other troops also arrived, including the troops of Pangeran Sempurna Jaya Putih. As it turned out, the Ketimbang fort had been abandoned by Radin Inten II and his troops. In this fort, the Belanda
              found food in large quantities. Fort Ketimbang has fallen into Belanda hands. However, Colonel Welson was disappointed, because Radin Inten II was not caught or surrendered. Welson sent his troops to various places to look for
              Radin Inten II. On the other hand, to confuse Belanda opinion, Radin Inten II spread fake news through his confidants. News circulated that he had given up on Way Urang. Welson immediately headed for Way Urang. As it turned
              out, the person he was looking for was not there. One woman also reported that Radin Inten II was in Rindeh and only accompanied by a few of her followers. The news turned out to be fake news. Once, the Belanda learned of the
              hiding place of Radin Inten II. The place was also under siege under the leadership of Captain Kohler. However, Radin Inten II managed to escape.
            </p>
            <p>
              By October 1856 it had been two and a half months since the Belanda had launched a military operation. One by one they managed to occupy the strongholds of Radin Inten II. However, Radin Inten II was still not caught.
              Meanwhile, the Belanda received a report that Radin Inten II had gone to the northern part of Lampung, crossing Way Seputih. Other news reports that Singaberanta is on Sebesi Island. Belanda directs troops to cut the road
              Radin Inten II. Troops were also sent to Sebesi Island to look for Singaberanta. The result is nil. Neither Radin Inten II nor Singaberanta were found. Colonel Welson almost gave up, he felt that he was being played by a young
              boy aged 22 years. Finally, Waleson found another way. He managed to use Radin Ngerapat. Then betrayal ensued. Radin Ngerapat invited Radin Inten II to hold a meeting. He said that he wanted to discuss the assistance he was
              giving Radin Inten II. Without suspicion, Radin Inten II fulfilled the invitation. The meeting was held the evening of October 5, 1856 at a place near Kunyanya. Radin Inten II was accompanied by one of his followers. Radin
              Ngerapat was accompanied by several people. However, in a fairly hidden place, several Belanda soldiers were prepared to act when needed. Radin Ngerapat invited Radin Inten II and his companions to eat the food he had brought
              first. When Radin Inten ate the food, suddenly he was attacked by Radin Ngerapat and his men. An unbalanced fight ensued. Belanda soldiers came out of their hiding places and joined in to gang up on Radin Inten II. Radin Inten
              II died in the fight because of treason committed by his fellow countrymen at the very young age of 22 years. That night his body, still covered in blood, was shown to Colonel Welson.
